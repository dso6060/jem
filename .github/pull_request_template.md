## Entity / files touched

## Local checks (required for `jem/data/**` changes)

Run from `jem/`:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py --strict
python3 scripts/validate_graph_refs.py
python3 scripts/derive.py
```

- [ ] `validate.py --strict` passes (0 errors)
- [ ] I ran `derive.py` if I changed fields that affect scores
- [ ] I did **not** hand-edit `jem/data/derived/` or commit a rebuilt `graph.json` unless maintainers asked for a release build

## Out of scope (confirm none of these)

- [ ] No case outcomes or party-specific results
- [ ] No individual judge names or conduct opinions
- [ ] No editorial commentary without structural sourcing

## Type of change

- [ ] Data-quality upgrade (community)
- [ ] Maintainer: structural / schema / tooling
- [ ] Maintainer: release (`graph.json` rebuild)
- [ ] Docs only
