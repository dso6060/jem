# Judiciary Entity Map (India) - JEM — Data Model & Score Formulae

All derived scores are computed by `scripts/derive.py` from structural
data fields. No editorial judgment is applied. Every point traces to a
data field documented here.

---

## Independence Risk Score

**Definition:** Measures structural conditions that create dependency,
opacity, or conflicts of interest in an entity's design.
Higher = more structural risk. Does not indicate actual misconduct.

**Scale:** 0–2 Low | 3–5 Moderate | 6–8 High | 9+ Severe

### Factors

| Factor | Points | Source field |
|---|---|---|
| Appointed directly by executive body | +3 | `appointment.formally_appoints` |
| Appointed by independent collegium | −2 | `appointment.nominates` contains "collegium" |
| Appointment via Parliamentary process | −1 | `appointment.formally_appoints` contains "parliament" |
| Reappointment possible by same executive | +2 | `appointment.reappointment_possible == true` AND appointer is executive |
| No publicly stated appointment criteria | +1 | `appointment.criteria_public == false` |
| Removal by same authority that appoints (no independent committee) | +1 | `appointment.removal_authority` == appointer AND `removal_independent_committee == false` |
| Removal requires Parliamentary process | −1 | `appointment.removal_requires_parliament == true` |
| Funder == Appointing authority | +2 | `funding.ministry_responsible` == appointer |
| Funded by parties (not state) | −1 | `funding.primary_source == Party_Fees` |
| No external financial audit | +1 | `audit.audit_type` is None or empty |
| No independent conduct oversight body | +1 | `audit.conduct_oversight_body` is empty |
| Conduct oversight body is the entity itself | +1 | `audit.conduct_oversight_body` == entity id |
| Audit reports not public | +1 | `audit.audit_report_public == false` |
| No bias complaint mechanism exists | +2 | `complaint_mechanism.bias_complaint_to` is empty |
| All complaint mechanisms are internal | +1 | No entry in `bias_complaint_to` has `external_to_judiciary == true` |
| Complaint process is not public | +1 | No entry has `is_public_process == true` |
| Complainant has no locus | +1 | No entry has `complainant_has_locus == true` |
| No defined timeframe for complaint | +1 | No entry has `timeframe_defined == true` |
| Lokpal has no jurisdiction | +1 | `complaint_mechanism.lokpal_jurisdiction == No` |
| Constitutional basis (harder to politicise) | −2 | `constitutional_basis` is populated |
| Statutory body not constituted — regulatory vacuum | +3 | `operational_status == Not_Constituted` |

**Minimum score: 0** (negative contributions cannot take score below zero)

## Discretionary Power Score

**Definition:** Measures concentration of discretionary decision-making power
in an entity. High discretionary power combined with high independence risk
is a structural concern. Discretionary power alone is not problematic.

**Scale:** 0–2 Low | 3–5 Moderate | 6–8 High | 9+ Very High

### Base score by entity type

| Type | Base |
|---|---|
| ConstitutionalCourt | 4 |
| AppointmentBody | 4 |
| RegulatoryBodyQJ | 3 |
| InvestigativeAgency | 3 |
| SubordinateCriminalCourt | 3 |
| SubordinateCivilCourt | 2 |
| SpecialCourt | 2 |
| CentralTribunal | 2 |
| AuditBody | 2 |
| ArbitralInstitution | 1 |
| All others | 1 |

### Entity-specific additions (documented extra-statutory discretion)

| Entity | Extra points | Documented basis |
|---|---|---|
| supreme_court_india | +5 | Master of Roster, PIL jurisdiction, suo moto, contempt |
| chief_justice_india | +5 | Master of Roster — no codified rules for bench allocation |
| collegium_sc | +5 | Entirely opaque appointment process, no statutory criteria |

### Universal factors

| Factor | Points |
|---|---|
| No public criteria for key decisions | +1 |
| Has removal authority over other entities | +1 |
| Controls own case listing / bench composition (ConstitutionalCourt only) | +2 |
| No universal mandatory timeline for all decisions | +1 |

## Governance nodes — score exclusions

Structural IR and DP scores apply to **adjudicatory, regulatory, and investigative**
entities whose independence and discretion matter for judicial governance analysis.
**Governance nodes** (officeholders, ministries, and abstract executive bodies) are
included in the relationship graph for appointment chains but are **not scored**.

`scripts/derive.py` sets both scores to **0** with breakdown key
`Scores excluded: governance officeholder or administrative body` when any of:

| Rule | Examples |
|---|---|
| `type == AppointmentBody` | **Not excluded** — committees remain scored |
| `id` starts with `ministry_` or `minister_` | `ministry_home_affairs`, `minister_home_affairs` |
| Fixed officeholder IDs | `president_india`, `prime_minister`, `chief_justice_india`, `governor_state`, Speakers, LoP, Deputy Chairman Rajya Sabha |
| `id` ends with `_lieutenant_governor` or `_advocate_general` | `dl_lieutenant_governor`, state AGs |
| `type == ExecutiveBody` and `cluster` in `legislative_executive` or `executive_interface` | `central_government`, Union ministries |

**Rationale:** Minister vs ministry (PHRA 1993 s.4, CVC Act 2003 s.4) and Lokpal Act
CBI Director committee are **appointment topology**, not bodies whose case volume or
bench composition is modeled. Appointment committees (`AppointmentBody`) retain scores
because they concentrate statutory appointment discretion.

## Scores & Community Validation

Scores are computed automatically but require human review to confirm that:
- The formula input fields are accurately populated
- The entity-specific extra-statutory discretion entries are sourced
- No data quality issues affect the inputs

Unvalidated scores display with a "⚐ Pending community review" badge in the UI.

To mark a score as validated, set in the entity YAML:
```yaml
derived:
  scores_validated: true
```
This should only be done after the entity's data quality is `verified`
and the score breakdown has been reviewed against primary sources.
