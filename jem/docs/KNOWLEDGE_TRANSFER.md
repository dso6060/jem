- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contributor rules
- [`DATA_MODEL.md`](DATA_MODEL.md) — score formulae
- [`MCP_SETUP.md`](MCP_SETUP.md) — REST search, MCP tools, API setup
- [`MCP_SETUP.md`](MCP_SETUP.md) — REST API, MCP HTTP tools, Cursor integration
- [`MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`](../../MASTER_CHECKLIST.md) — version roadmap v0.9 → v2.0

## 2. Executive summary

**JEM** is an open-source **structural map** of India's judicial ecosystem. It does not record case outcomes, judge conduct, or editorial opinions. It records **how institutions are built and connected**: who appoints whom, who funds whom, appellate chains, complaint pathways, digital infrastructure, security arrangements, case-volume indicators, and documented **structural gaps** (e.g. bodies legislated but never constituted).

**Mission (operational framing):** Structural literacy that consolidates and presents the **functional or operational capacity** of judicial entities — a dashboard-oriented view of **court carrying capacity** for better administration and public understanding. Intended stakeholders include judicial administrators, litigants, journalists, the CJI's office, ministry officials, bureaucrats, researchers, and civic-tech users.

**Current state (Jun 2026):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Entity YAML files | 1,103 |
| Relationships in `graph.json` | 1,858 |
| Built graph size | ~5.5 MB |
| `validate.py` | 0 errors (strict) |
| Live site | May 2026 build (~506 entities) — **v1.0.0 deploy pending** |
| Git tags | `v1.0.0` (Jun 2026), `v1.2.0` (data-only milestone, Jun 15) |
| `graph.json` meta.version | `1.0.0` |
| Data entry | Founder + Cursor/Claude sessions only |
| GitHub remote | [`datastiltskin/jem`](https://github.com/datastiltskin/jem) (public repo) |
| Community contributions | **Not open yet** — planned: data-quality upgrades only |

**Funding:** Personally funded to date; no grants documented. May change later.

## 3. What JEM is — and is not

### 3.1 In scope

- Institutional entities (courts, tribunals, regulators, ministries, appointment bodies, etc.)
- Typed relationships (appointment, funding, appellate, supervisory, audit, complaint, digital, security)
- Algorithmic **Independence Risk** and **Discretionary Power** scores (structural indicators, not conduct judgments)
- Case-volume / clog fields where sourced (NJDG snapshots, DoJ reports)
- **Gap registry** — documented shortfalls (vacancies, not constituted, circularity)
- Interactive map: semantic zoom L0–L3, timeline scroller, relationship lenses

### 3.2 Out of scope (by design)

- Case outcomes (who won/lost)
- Individual judge names or performance opinions
- Editorial commentary or political campaigning
- Revenue-administration chains, military justice depth, individual DLSAs (650+) — see README gap registry §E for sibling-project candidates

### 4.3 Visualisation levels

| Level | View | Interaction |
|-------|------|-------------|
| L0 | Cluster constellations | Default / zoom out |
| L1 | Entity nodes, DAG layout | Zoom in / click cluster |
| L2 | Sub-entities, edge labels | Zoom further |
| L3 | Detail panel, sources, scores | Click entity |

**Font = data quality:** verified (bold) → complete → partial (grey italic) → unverified → contested (red dotted). Dashed border = `Not_Constituted`.

---

## 5. How data was collected

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Who entered data** | Project founder only, via Cursor/Claude-assisted sessions |
| **Methods** | Hand-authored YAML; seed files; generator scripts for state bundles and TN district lattice |
| **Case volume / NJDG** | Founder's **own export/scrape** of NJDG (National Judicial Data Grid) — not a third-party dataset. Merged via `merge_njdg_snapshot.py` (139 entities updated in May 2026 pass). Plan doc: `NJDG_MERGE_PLAN.md` |
| **Other numerics** | DoJ vacancy reports, HC annual reports where cited in entity `sources` |
| **Reproducibility** | All structural claims should cite `sources[]` with URLs; `data_quality` reflects confidence |

**Credentials / secrets:** None required for v0.9 static build. Live NJDG API (`fetch_njdg.py`) is planned for v2 — document keys and cron when implemented.

---

## 6. Data trust tiers (recommended mental model)

Use this when reviewing PRs or answering "how much can I trust this entity?"

| Tier | Scope | Trust level | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **A — Core backbone** | SC, HCs, central tribunals, key regulators, governance wiring (May 2026 sessions) | Highest structural intent | Relationships actively wired; many fields `partial`, 9 `verified` |
| **B — Reference state packs** | MH, DL, KA, TN (38 districts), PY | Strong structure, variable numerics | TN has collapse/expand district lattice; NJDG merged where snapshot matched |
| **C — Bootstrap states** | ~31 states with `*_district_courts_generic` only | Structural scaffold | Correct *types* of bodies; not district-resolved |
| **D — Numeric overlays** | `case_volume`, `judge_strength` | Sparse | ~84/506 with `pending_cases`; ~2/506 with `judge_strength`; all `scores_validated: false` |

**Repo-wide audit (May 2026):** 506 entities — `verified`: 9, `partial`: 497, `scores_validated`: 0.

**Co-maintainer rule of thumb:** Do not treat the map as litigation-grade statistics until numerics are sourced per entity. Treat **relationship topology** in Tiers A–B as the primary v0.9 asset.

---

## 7. Validation — automated, maintainer, and community

### 7.1 Automated (every PR touching `jem/data/**` or `jem/scripts/**`)

1. **`validate.py --strict`** — Pydantic schema: required fields, enums, funding sources, etc.
2. **`derive.py`** — Recomputes Independence Risk / Discretionary Power → `data/derived/`
3. **`validate_graph_refs.py`** — Relationship endpoints exist; `--strict` for orphan trends

CI does **not** run `build.py` or deploy.

### 7.2 Maintainer validation (founder → shared with co-maintainer)

- Primary source check before `data_quality: verified`
- `derive.py --explain <entity_id>` for score sanity
- Disputed facts → `data_quality: contested` + both sources (no "resolution by opinion")
- **`derived.scores_validated: true`** only after verified data + score breakdown review

### 7.3 Community validation — options for your kickoff call

| Option | Model | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **A — Issues only** | Contributors file issues with sources; maintainers edit YAML | Lowest risk | Slow scale |
| **B — PR: data-quality only** ✓ *recommended launch* | Community PRs limited to upgrading `partial`→`complete`/`verified`, sources, `data_quality_notes` | Scales review; no structural rewrites | Needs clear PR template |
| **C — CODEOWNERS** | `@maintainers` required on `jem/data/**` | Enforces 2-person review | Setup overhead |
| **D — Discussions → PR** | Disputes discussed in GitHub Discussions before YAML change | Good for contested facts | Needs moderation |
| **E — Domain reviewers** | Volunteer "owners" per cluster (courts, tax, labour) | Expertise depth | Hard to recruit early |

**Recommended v0.9 package:** **B + C + D**

- Public repo + `CONTRIBUTING.md` + issue templates (`data-correction`, `source-request`)
- **CODEOWNERS:** both maintainers on `jem/data/**`
- **Branch protection:** PR required, 1 approval from CODEOWNERS, CI green
- **Scope lock:** community may only submit **data-quality upgrades** (see §8); core entity/relationship additions stay maintainer-only until explicitly opened
- **Disputes:** documented escalation (Discussion → maintainer decision → `contested` flag if unresolved)

### 7.4 Known technical debt (acceptable for v0.9)

- **~139 relationship orphans** — incremental wiring scheduled v1.1+
- **0 scores community-validated** — UI shows "Pending community review" everywhere
- Missing docs referenced in older README (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SOURCES.md`, `ENTITY_TAXONOMY.md`) — use `DATA_MODEL.md` + this guide instead

---

## 8. Contribution model (agreed direction)

| Who | Can do |
|-----|--------|
| **Community (initial)** | Data-quality upgrades only: sources, `data_quality`, `data_quality_notes`, correcting factual fields with primary links |
| **Maintainers (you + co-maintainer)** | New entities, relationships, schema changes, generators, web UI, `derive.py` formulae, releases |
| **Founder only (for now)** | Production deploy (private host) |

**Later expansion (explicit decision required):** new state packs, gap-registry entities, relationship bulk wiring.

---

## 9. GitHub & community launch plan

**Founder:** [@dso6060](https://github.com/dso6060) · **Co-maintainers:** [@Prajna1999](https://github.com/Prajna1999) and [@agriyakhetarpal](https://github.com/agriyakhetarpal) · Repo: [datastiltskin/jem](https://github.com/datastiltskin/jem)

Scaffolding is in **`.github/`** (ready before first push):

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`CODEOWNERS`](../../.github/CODEOWNERS) | `@dso6060` on `jem/data`, scripts, web, docs |
| [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../../.github/GOVERNANCE.md) | Roles, scope, escalation |
| [`PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md`](../../.github/PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md) | Publish steps — repo [datastiltskin/jem](https://github.com/datastiltskin/jem); branch protection TBD |
| [`pull_request_template.md`](../../.github/pull_request_template.md) | PR checklist |
| [`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) | `data_correction`, `source_request`, `bug_report`, `contested_fact`, `expert_review` |
| [`DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`](../../.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/) | `data-question`, `dispute-escalation` |
| [`TEAM.md`](TEAM.md) | Placeholders: co-maintainer, legal expert, think-tank liaisons |
| [`workflows/validate.yml`](../../.github/workflows/validate.yml) | `validate.py` + `derive.py` + `validate_graph_refs.py` |

**On publish:** enable Discussions, branch protection (PR + CI + CODEOWNERS), create labels per publish checklist.

**Not in co-maintainer scope:** production server access, rsync credentials, DNS.

---

## 10. Deployment (founder-operated, generic host)

**Canonical demo (attribution):** https://friedso.com/apps/jem/

- Deploy procedure: [`V1_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md`](V1_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md) — rsync, S3, Netlify, or any static host; set `JEM_REMOTE` / `JEM_PUBLIC_URL` locally (never commit real values).
- **Critical:** ship repo-root `graph.json` as a real file at `public/graph.json` (symlinks often break on static hosts).
- Preflight: `./jem/scripts/deploy_prep.sh`

**Mirrors:** Anyone may host `jem/web/` + `graph.json`; courtesy attribution: *Structural data from [JEM](https://friedso.com/apps/jem/).*

---

## 11. Versioning note: v1.0.0 vs build metadata

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **v1.0.0 (public)** | First public semver release (Jun 2026) — 1,103 entities, full state/UT packs, UI refresh |
| **graph.json `meta.version: 1.0.0`** | Internal compiler label — not the same as git tag |
| **git tags** | `v1.0.0` (Jun 16 2026, UI + corpus); `v1.2.0` (Jun 15 data milestone, pre-UI merge) |

---

## 12. Roadmap summary

| Release | Focus |
|---------|--------|
| **v0.9** (now) | Stabilise UI/data; GitHub public; contribution process |
| **v1.0** | Tag after smoke tests + agreed quality bar |
| **v1.1** | Bench routing, config sync, orphan reduction |
| **v1.2** | Bulk `judge_strength` + `case_volume` (DoJ/NJDG) |
| **v1.3** | Per-district NJDG (blocked on exports) |
| **v1.4** | Remaining state district lattices |
| **v1.5** | Gap registry entities (tax, labour, defence benches) |
| **v2.0** | Canvas renderer, live NJDG API, Sankey, litigant journey, optional CI deploy |

**Phased geography:**

- Phase 0: Central + TN + PY — done  
- Phase 1: MH, DL, KA — done  
- Phase 2–3: Other states / districts — community + maintainers (later)

---

## 13. Success metrics (targets)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Structural entities | ~1,500 (from ~506) |
| External contributors | 10+ with merged data-quality PRs |
| Data freshness | Monthly NJDG/DoJ refresh (post v2 API) |
| Orphan relationships | Trending down; strict ref check near zero for touched packs |
| `verified` entities | Growth from 9 → majority of Tier A/B |
| Community-validated scores | Tier A entities first |

---

## 14. Known gaps & access control

| Gap | Status / action |
|-----|------------------|
| Public GitHub repo live | Founder + co-maintainers maintain access and branch protection |
| Contribution process | Documented here; implement templates + CODEOWNERS on create |
| CI does not build/deploy graph on merge | Maintainers run pipeline locally before release tags |
| Production deploy | Founder only |
| Org size | 2 admins now; up to 5 members later |
| Legal disclaimer | Add to README + site footer (§15) |
| Live NJDG | Not built — static snapshots only |
| Domain experts | TBD |

---

## 15. Suggested legal disclaimer (README + site)

> **Disclaimer.** Judiciary Entity Map (India) (JEM) presents structural information about institutions and their formal relationships, derived from public sources. It does not provide legal advice, predict case outcomes, or assess individual conduct. Independence Risk and Discretionary Power scores are algorithmic indicators of *structural design*, not findings of bias or misconduct. Data may be incomplete or outdated; verify critical facts against primary sources before relying on them in litigation, policy, or journalism. Maintainers welcome corrections via GitHub with citations.

---

## 16. Licences & attribution

| Component | Licence | Attribution |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `jem/data/` | **CC0** | None required; courtesy link appreciated |
| `jem/scripts/`, `jem/web/` | **MIT** | Standard MIT notice in copies |

**Suggested courtesy (not required):**  
*"Structural data from [Judiciary Entity Map (JEM)](https://friedso.com/apps/jem/)."*

Optional future: `CONTRIBUTORS.md` listing merged PR authors.

---

## 17. Co-maintainer handoff checklist

- [ ] Clone repo; `cd jem && pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`
- [ ] Run `python3 scripts/validate.py --strict` (expect 0 errors)
- [ ] Run `./scripts/safe_pipeline.sh`; confirm `graph.json` meta ~1,103 entities
- [ ] Open local `jem/web/` via static server; click SC, Madras HC, TN district collapse
- [ ] Read `DATA_MODEL.md` § governance exclusions + score formulae
- [ ] Read `SESSION_WORKFLOW.md` § overwrite risks (`build.py`, generators)
- [ ] Join GitHub org/repo as admin when created
- [ ] Agree on: PR scope (data-quality only), dispute escalation, v0.9.0 tag criteria
- [ ] Schedule call: repo name, issue templates, first community announcement

---

## 18. Essential commands

```bash
cd jem
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Standard session
python3 scripts/validate.py --strict
python3 scripts/validate_graph_refs.py
python3 scripts/derive.py
python3 scripts/build.py

# Explain one entity's scores
python3 scripts/derive.py --explain nclt

# Safe experiment (does not overwrite production graph)
./scripts/build_safe.sh
```

---

## 19. Key contacts

| Role | Contact |
|------|---------|
| Project founder / deploy | **Divya Sornaraja** · GitHub [@dso6060](https://github.com/dso6060) |
| Co-maintainers | **Prajna Prayas** (`@Prajna1999`) · **Agriya Khetarpal** (`@agriyakhetarpal`) |
| Domain reviewers (institutional) | [TrustBridge Rule of Law Foundation](https://trustbridge.in/) — *partnership / advisory role to be officially confirmed* |

---

## 20. Uniform AI prompt (Claude / Cursor / ChatGPT)

Everyone adding or correcting data should use the **same prompt** so YAML stays schema-safe and source-backed.

| Role | Workflow |
|------|----------|
| **Contributor** | `ROLE: contributor` + roadmap `TASK` → YAML drafts → **GitHub issue only** → maintainers validate & merge |
| **Co-maintainer** | `ROLE: co-maintainer` → validate locally → PR; wire **relationships** when category needs edges |

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Submissions | **GitHub issues only** (no email) |
| New entities | Proposed drafts OK when roadmap TASK allows |
| Relationships | **Maintainer-only** |

**Maintainers validating a contributor file:**

```bash
cd jem && python3 scripts/validate.py --entity path/to/submitted_file.yaml
```

### Copy-paste prompt (full)

Use [`AI_DATA_ENTRY_PROMPT.md`](AI_DATA_ENTRY_PROMPT.md) — single source for the prompt box (do not duplicate here).

Pick a phased **TASK** from [`ENTITY_BUILD_ROADMAP.md`](ENTITY_BUILD_ROADMAP.md) **Active prompts** only; when a category is **done**, its prompt moves to the roadmap archive and is removed from the active list.

**One-liner (Cursor):** `Follow jem/docs/AI_DATA_ENTRY_PROMPT.md; ROLE: co-maintainer; TASK from ENTITY_BUILD_ROADMAP.md P1-A`

### Phased prompts toward 1,500+ entities

| Resource | Use |
|----------|-----|
| [`ENTITY_BUILD_ROADMAP.md`](ENTITY_BUILD_ROADMAP.md) | Category tracker (pending / updated / done), Phase 1–3 **active prompts**, archive when done |
| [README § Entity build progress](../../README.md#entity-build-progress) | Public status table — **sync when a category is marked done** |

**Maintainer closure:** (1) merge data → (2) wire relationships in separate session → (3) set category **done** → (4) move prompt to archive → (5) update README table.

---

## 21. Origin (brief)

JEM began from the absence of a **public, machine-readable map** of how India's ~1,500 judicial and quasi-judicial bodies connect — appointment power, funding, oversight, and capacity signals — in one place. It is a **personally funded** civic/research infrastructure project, with a public demo at https://friedso.com/apps/jem/ (attribution), hosted on **GitHub** at [datastiltskin/jem](https://github.com/datastiltskin/jem), which others can fork, mirror, and improve under CC0/MIT.
