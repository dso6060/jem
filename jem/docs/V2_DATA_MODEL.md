# JEM v2.0 — Data model additions

License: CC0

This document records schema and UI fields introduced for **v2.0** that were not in the original v1 checklist (Canvas renderer, NJDG live fetch, major litigants, etc.).

## 1. High Court permanent benches

### Entity type: `HighCourtBench`

Permanent benches of a High Court (e.g. Madurai Bench of Madras HC) are **not** district courts and **not** the consolidated `hc_*` node alone.

**Map rendering:** `HighCourtBench` nodes use a **crescent** shape (not a full circle) so they are visually distinct from principal `hc_*` circles and district courts. See `jem/web/src/nodeShapes.js`.

| Field | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `type` | `HighCourtBench` |
| `cluster` | `constitutional_courts` |
| `parent_hc` | Parent entity id, e.g. `hc_madras` |
| `seat_city` | Bench city (generator field; optional in schema) |

### Relationship: `BenchOf`

- **Source:** bench entity  
- **Target:** parent `hc_*`  
- **Category:** `statutory_ref`

### District routing

Where a state pack lists explicit districts, appellate and supervision edges may target a **bench** instead of the parent HC when configured in `jem/scripts/hc_benches_config.py` (TN Madurai bench, MH Nagpur/Aurangabad, KA Dharwad, etc.). Principal-seat districts continue to use `hc_*` directly.

### Generator

Run from repo root:

```bash
python3 jem/scripts/generate_v1_states_bundle.py
```

Bench YAML is written under `jem/data/entities/_generated/high_courts/benches/`.

## 2. Judge strength (allotted & appointed)

### Block: `judge_strength`

Required on all **court** and **court-like** entities in v2.0 data passes.

| Field | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `allotted` | Sanctioned posts (DoJ / NJDG “sanctioned strength”) |
| `appointed` | Working judges actually in post |
| `vacancy_count` | Optional; may be derived as `allotted − appointed` |
| `data_as_of` | ISO date of snapshot |
| `source_type` | `DoJ_Report`, `NJDG_Snapshot`, `HC_Report`, etc. |
| `source_url` | Primary URL |

**Legacy:** `case_volume.sanctioned_strength` / `working_strength` remain valid; the detail panel prefers `judge_strength` and falls back to `case_volume` for display.

### UI

The Level 3 detail panel always shows a **Judge strength** section for court-like types, with “Not yet recorded” when values are null.

### Validation

`JudgeStrengthModel` in `jem/scripts/validate.py`; optional fields may be null in partial data.

---

## 3. HC → Supreme Court appellate backbone

The generator adds `AppealableTo` / `appellate_chain` from each `hc_*` to `supreme_court_india` (Article 136 / SLP framing in `notes`).
