**Open structural map of India's judicial ecosystem — institutional capacity, relationships, and systemic gaps.**

An open, honest structural study of the Indian judicial ecosystem.
Maps institutional relationships — appointment chains, funding flows,
oversight mechanisms, complaint pathways — not case outcomes.

## What this is

The Indian judiciary involves roughly 1,500 distinct institutional entities across constitutional courts, subordinate courts, central and state tribunals, arbitration bodies, regulatory quasi-judicial bodies, investigative agencies, digital infrastructure bodies, audit bodies, and training institutions. No public map of their structural relationships exists.

JEM maps:
- Who appoints whom, and whether that appointment is binding
- Who funds whom, and whether the funder equals the appointer
- Which audit bodies exist for each entity
- Which complaint mechanisms exist for bias or misconduct, and whether complainants have locus
- How digital infrastructure is governed (e-Committee vs DoJ vs NIC)
- Where bodies have been legislated but never constituted

**Independence Risk** and **Discretionary Power** scores are algorithmically derived from structural data attributes. They are structural indicators, not judgments on conduct. All scores are labelled "Pending community review" until validated.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# 2. Validate all data files
python scripts/validate.py

# 3. Derive structural scores
python scripts/derive.py

# 4. Build graph.json (written to ../graph.json at the repo root; web/public/graph.json is a symlink)
python scripts/build.py

# 4b. Safe staging build (does NOT overwrite repo-root graph.json)
./scripts/build_safe.sh

# 5. Local preview or deploy (see docs/V1_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md — generic static host)
# cd web && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

The frontend requires no build step. It is vanilla HTML + JS + CSS.
All CDN dependencies load from jsdelivr/cdnjs.

## Visualisation

The map uses **semantic zoom** — four levels of detail:

| Level | What you see | How to reach it |
|---|---|---|
| L0 Constellation | 8 cluster blocks, aggregate metrics | Default / zoom out fully |
| L1 Backbone | Individual entity nodes, DAG layout | Scroll in / click cluster |
| L2 Sub-entity | Sub-entities, edge labels | Scroll in further |
| L3 Detail | Full entity card, sources, score breakdown | Click any entity |

The **time scroller** (1950 → present) is persistent across all levels.
Dragging it fades in/out entities based on `created_year` and `abolished_year`.

**Font = data quality:**
- Black bold = `verified` (primary source confirmed)
- Black normal = `complete`
- Grey italic = `partial` (some fields missing)
- Light-grey italic = `unverified`
- Red dotted-underline italic = `contested`
- Dashed node border = `Not_Constituted` (legislated but not set up)
- Faded / strikethrough = `Abolished`

---

## Adding entities

See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`. Short version:

1. Copy the closest existing YAML from `data/entities/`
2. Fill all fields — at minimum: `id`, `name`, `type`, `cluster`, `level_of_government`, `created_year`, `operational_status`, `data_quality`, `sources`
3. Run `python scripts/validate.py --entity path/to/your/file.yaml`
4. Open a PR — GitHub Actions validates automatically

Do not set `data_quality: verified` unless you have a direct link to a primary Government of India source.
